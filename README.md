Math Race is a mobile first
puzzle game. Players go head-to-head at solve increasingly difficult
math equations ranging from basic arithmetic to
single-variable calculus.
Each race is unique, as an algorithm generates never seen before
questions for each round. Players give their answer in a Kahoot
style manner, the first player to
answer every question wins.
