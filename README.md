# MathRacePuzzleGame

```
Math race is designed to be a mobile first 
puzzle game experience on the web. 
The core of the game is simple, players that 
participate in a race go head 
to head at attempting to solve increasingly difficult 
math equations. Problems 
range from 1st grade difficulty, and cap out at the 
single-variable calculus level. 
Each race will be unique, as an algorithm will 
procedurally generate never seen before 
questions for each round. Players 
will give their answer in a Kahoot 
style manner, the first player to 
answer every question wins.
